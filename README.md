## Customer-Segmentation-Engine

# Project Overview
I developed a Customer Segmentation Engine to group customers into distinct clusters based on their purchase history, enabling targeted marketing strategies. Using an e-commerce dataset, I applied data wrangling to preprocess the data, visualized customer patterns, and implemented a clustering algorithm to identify segments like "frequent buyers," "high spenders," or "occasional shoppers." This project demonstrates practical business value and technical proficiency.
